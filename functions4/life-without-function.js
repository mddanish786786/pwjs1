/* if a bunch of code will be copied paste with the same logic and 
without function then problem will be occured when we will required to 
change something in the code. this will let you to change all of the copied 
codes will take lots of time and programing ambiguity. so the the life without function 
will become so hectic and inappropriate production life cycle.

Hence function is most important part of a programing environment 
to reusiblity of the code.
